# Updated-Typing-Speed-Calculator-using-Python
This is updated version of Python Typing speed calculator, the  original version was functional but lacked some advanced features which are added in this to enhance the user experience. 
As part of my CodeClause Internship, I had made typing speed calculator using python and this is the upgraded version of my Typing Speed Test Application built with Python and Tkinter.

💡 What’s New?

1️⃣ Real-Time Feedback with Highlighting 🎨:

Each letter typed is now dynamically highlighted:
✅ Green for correct letters.
❌ Red for incorrect ones.
🔲 Black for yet-to-be-typed letters.
This visual feedback helps users immediately identify and correct errors, improving typing accuracy and learning efficiency.
2️⃣ Improved Text Wrapping 📃:

Words no longer split awkwardly when they reach the edge of the text area.
Now, complete words gracefully shift to the next line, ensuring better readability and usability.
✨ These updates not only enhance the application's functionality but also make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and practical for improving typing skills.

🎯 Skills Applied & Lessons Learned:

Python programming for logic building.
Tkinter for GUI enhancements.
Implementing real-time updates and dynamic UI adjustments.
A deeper understanding of user-centric design.
I'm have successfully made the enhancements and i am excited to share the updated project with the community! 🚀
